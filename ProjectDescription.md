# 311-Regex

 Students were instructed to create a program in Java that could parse a limited subset
 of regular expressions. This program could not contain any of the built-in regular expression
 utilities in the Java language; it had to manually create a state machine suiting the user’s
 regular expression and then use it to evaluate a text file of the user’s choosing.
